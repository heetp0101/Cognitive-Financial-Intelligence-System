## Project overview
Cognitive Financial Intelligence System (CFIS) is a modular platform designed to apply advanced machine learning and natural language capabilities to financial datasets. The system ingests market, economic and textual data (e.g., news, filings), performs feature extraction and signal generation, trains predictive or classification models, and exposes inference through an API and optional UI. The codebase is organized to separate data ingestion, preprocessing, model training, model serving, and frontend visualization.

This README provides a technical, reproducible guide to set up, run, and extend the CFIS locally and for deployment.

---

## Key features
- Robust data ingestion pipelines for structured and unstructured financial data
- Preprocessing modules supporting normalization, feature engineering, time-series windowing, and text embedding
- Model training scaffolding for supervised and unsupervised models (classification, regression, forecasting, anomaly detection)
- Model persistence, versioning and checkpointing
- Inference API for batch and real-time scoring
- (Optional) Web UI for visualization and human-in-the-loop analyses
- Docker manifests for containerized reproducibility

---

## Architectural overview
The system is separated into the following logical components:

- data/: Data ingestion, connectors, and preprocessing pipelines
- models/: Model architectures, training loops, evaluation and persistence
- api/: Model-serving REST API (FastAPI/Flask/Express)
- frontend/: Web-based visualization (React/Vue) â€” optional
- infra/: Dockerfiles, docker-compose, Kubernetes manifests, and infra utilities
- experiments/: Notebooks and experiment tracking artifacts (e.g., MLflow/Weights & Biases)

Data flows:
1. Raw data sources -> ingestion connectors
2. Ingested raw -> preprocessing -> feature store / intermediate parquet/csv
3. Feature store -> model training / offline evaluation
4. Trained model -> registry -> model server -> API -> clients / UI

---

## Technology stack (suggested / typical)
- Language: Python 3.10+ for backend, data and models
- Web API: FastAPI or Flask (ASGI recommended)
- Data processing: pandas, numpy, pyarrow, parquet
- ML frameworks: scikit-learn, XGBoost/LightGBM, PyTorch or TensorFlow (for deep learning)
- NLP/Embeddings: Hugging Face Transformers or sentence-transformers
- Experiment tracking: MLflow or Weights & Biases
- Containerization: Docker, docker-compose
- Frontend (optional): Node.js 18+, React or Vue, Vite or Next.js
- Database / storage: PostgreSQL or SQLite for metadata; S3-compatible object storage for large artifacts
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions
- Orchestration (optional): Kubernetes

Adjust versions to match the implementation in this repository.

## Repository layout
(Adjust these paths to the actual layout in your repo)
- /data/: ingestion and preprocessing scripts
- /models/: model definitions, training scripts, evaluation
- /api/: REST API server and inference endpoints
- /frontend/: optional web client
- /notebooks/: exploratory notebooks and reproducible analysis
- /infra/: Docker and deployment manifests
- requirements.txt or pyproject.toml: Python dependencies

---

## System requirements
- OS: Linux / macOS / Windows (WSL recommended for Windows)
- Python: 3.10 or 3.11 (use pyenv/conda)
- Node.js: 18+ (only if frontend present)
- Docker (optional for containerized runs)
- RAM & CPU: Depends on dataset and models; 16GB RAM recommended for moderate experiments
- GPU: Optional but required for large neural models; CUDA-compatible GPU for PyTorch/TensorFlow acceleration

---

## Local setup and run (development)

Below are reproducible steps to get the project running locally. Adjust any path/command if your repo uses a different structure.

1) Clone the repository
- Replace the URL with your fork if necessary
```bash
git clone https://github.com/heetp0101/Cognitive-Financial-Intelligence-System.git
cd Cognitive-Financial-Intelligence-System
git switch main  # or the branch you use
```

2) Create and activate a Python virtual environment
```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
# macOS / Linux
source .venv/bin/activate
# Windows (PowerShell)
.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
```

3) Install Python dependencies
- If the repository uses requirements.txt:
```bash
pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
- If pyproject.toml / Poetry is used:
```bash
pip install "poetry>=1.2"
poetry install
poetry shell
```

4) Node / frontend (optional)
If there is a frontend folder:
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev  # or `npm run start` / `npm run build`
```

5) Environment variables
Create a `.env` file at repository root (or set environment variables in your shell). Example keys (adjust to actual implementation):
```
# .env
PYTHONPATH=.
FLASK_ENV=development
API_HOST=0.0.0.0
API_PORT=8000
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///data/metadata.db
MODEL_REGISTRY_PATH=./models/checkpoints
S3_ENDPOINT=
S3_ACCESS_KEY=
S3_SECRET_KEY=
MLFLOW_TRACKING_URI=http://localhost:5000
SECRET_KEY=your_secret_here
```
Never commit secrets to source control.

6) Data ingestion and preprocessing
- Place raw data in data/raw/ or configure external data sources
- Run ingestion script (example)
```bash
python data/ingest/ingest_market_data.py --config data/config/ingest.yml
```
- Run preprocessing to produce features
```bash
python data/preprocess/build_features.py --input data/raw --output data/processed
```
These scripts typically accept flags such as date range, providers, or sample size.

7) Model training
- Run the training script. Example patterns:
```bash
python models/train.py --config models/config/train_xgb.yaml --output models/artifacts
```
- Typical config entries:
  - dataset path
  - feature columns
  - target column
  - model hyperparameters
  - cross-validation scheme
  - checkpoint directory

- After training, models should be saved under models/checkpoints or exported to the registry configured in `.env`.

8) Launch the API server (inference)
- If using FastAPI:
```bash
uvicorn api.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```
- If using Flask:
```bash
export FLASK_APP=api.app
flask run --host=0.0.0.0 --port=8000
```

9) Run with Docker (optional)
- Build the image:
```bash
docker build -t cfis:local .
```
- Run with docker-compose:
```bash
docker-compose up --build
```
- Use Docker to ensure consistent environment (pins Python version, dependencies, system libs).

If you want, I can:
- tailor this README to the exact directories, commands, and scripts in your repository (send me the repository tree or the main scripts you run), or
- generate a Dockerfile / docker-compose.yml or CI pipeline (GitHub Actions) scaffold specific to this project.
